# STATS 220

This is *my* repo for **STATS 220**.

### A little about me:

1. I am current studying at the University of Auckland. 
    - Undertaking a Bachelor of Science degree.
    - Majoring in Computer Science.
2. I am taking [STATS 220](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1253) because the course teaches R programming.
3. I am interested in learning about the R programming language.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
