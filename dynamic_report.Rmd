## Report on the Supermarket Self-Checkout Data

This is a dynamic report on the data collected using the Supermarket Self-Checkout 
Google Form created as part of this project. The data collected is the 
observational data on self-checkout in different supermarkets, such as the 
supermarket name, time spent using the self-checkout, and whether the 
participant used their own shopping bags.

## Self-checkout Duration

From the data collected, we see that a customer using a self-service checkout 
kiosk at a supermarket takes on average `r mean_duration` seconds to purchase 
their groceries or other items. The fastest recorded time at a self-checkout 
for someone to purchase their item is `r min_duration` seconds. On the contrary, 
the longest recorded time for someone to finish purchasing their grocery at a 
self-checkout is `r max_duration` seconds.


## Average Self-checkout Duration Based On Supermarket

Is there a difference on how long a person using a self-service checkout kiost 
takes depending on what supermarket they go to? Using the data collected, I 
calculated the average self-checkout duration for each of the supermarkets. The 
following bar graph shows the average self-checkout duration depending on the 
supermarket.

## How many people brough their own bag?

Do most people bring their own bags to use when buying groceries? Using the data 
collected, the following bar graph shows the number of people using the self-checkout 
who uses their own bags compared to those who did not and purchased a bag.
